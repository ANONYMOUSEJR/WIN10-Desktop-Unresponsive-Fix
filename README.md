# WIN10-Desktop-Unresponsive-Fix

Having to go to the task manager to manually find Windows Explorer everytime my desktop/taskbar got unresponsive annoyed me greatly.

So i decided to make a simple batch program to automate the process for me.

Using "taskkill" to end the program and then "start" to start it up again.

Thats about it...
